Robot2D - simple 2D Engine.   
\
Idea of project - learning, have fun and sometimes make games on it :) 
\
Before Version 0.3 it was like small framework. 
Just now make course is make Editor and started to be real Engine!

Many Api's will be make private and using only in Engine Ecosystem and you will work with it like Unity, Godot and other big projects.
